# CoreLib

#### Helpful tools and classes for building modern apps.

---

This project contains a multitude of tools and classes for .NET that enable creation of modern, powerful apps using algorithms that are agnostic.
It is the successor to the [`Riverside.Runtime`](https://nuget.org/packages/Riverside.Runtime) project, and complements the [Toolkit](https://github.com/RiversideValley/Toolkit).

This repository houses both the `Riverside.Extensions` package and the `Riverside.Private.CoreLib` project, the former with more advanced algorithms and the latter with primitive structures and helpers.
